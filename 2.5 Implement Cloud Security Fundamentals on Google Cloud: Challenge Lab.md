# Implement Cloud Security Fundamentals on Google Cloud: Challenge Lab

This document outlines the steps to set up a Google Cloud environment focusing on cloud security fundamentals. The process involves creating service accounts, custom roles, and a Kubernetes cluster, while ensuring proper IAM policies are applied.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure you have:
- Google Cloud SDK installed and configured.
- Permissions to create resources in your Google Cloud project.

Set the following environment variables in your terminal to customize the setup:

```bash
export CUSTOM_ROLE=YOUR_CUSTOM_ROLE_NAME
export S_A=YOUR_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_NAME
export CLUSTER=YOUR_CLUSTER_NAME
export ZONE=YOUR_COMPUTE_ZONE
```

- `CUSTOM_ROLE`: The name of the custom role you want to create.
- `S_A`: The name of the service account.
- `CLUSTER`: The name for your Kubernetes cluster.
- `ZONE`: The compute zone where you want to deploy resources.

## Set Compute Zone

Set the default compute zone for your Google Cloud project. This step ensures that all subsequent commands use this zone unless specified otherwise.

```bash
gcloud config set compute/zone $ZONE
```

## Create Role Definition

Define a custom role in a YAML file, specifying the permissions it will include. In this example, the role has permissions related to Google Cloud Storage.

```bash
cat > role-definition.yaml <<EOF_END
title: "$CUSTOM_ROLE"
description: "Permissions"
stage: "ALPHA"
includedPermissions:
- storage.buckets.get
- storage.objects.get
- storage.objects.list
- storage.objects.update
- storage.objects.create
EOF_END
```

- **Title**: A user-friendly name for the role.
- **Description**: A brief explanation of what the role does.
- **Stage**: The development stage of the role (e.g., ALPHA).
- **Included Permissions**: Lists the specific permissions assigned to this role.

## Create Service Account

Create a service account that will be used by the private Kubernetes cluster.

```bash
gcloud iam service-accounts create orca-private-cluster-sa --display-name "Orca Private Cluster Service Account"
```

The service account is essential for granting access to Google Cloud resources.

## Create Custom Role

Create the custom role defined in the YAML file you created earlier. This role will be associated with the service account.

```bash
gcloud iam roles create $CUSTOM_ROLE --project $DEVSHELL_PROJECT_ID --file role-definition.yaml
```

## Create Another Service Account

Create an additional service account for monitoring purposes.

```bash
gcloud iam service-accounts create $S_A --display-name "Orca Service Account"
```

## Add IAM Policy Bindings

Bind the necessary IAM roles to the service account. This step grants the service account permissions to view and write monitoring data, as well as write logs.

```bash
gcloud projects add-iam-policy-binding $DEVSHELL_PROJECT_ID --member serviceAccount:$S_A@$DEVSHELL_PROJECT_ID.iam.gserviceaccount.com --role roles/monitoring.viewer

gcloud projects add-iam-policy-binding $DEVSHELL_PROJECT_ID --member serviceAccount:$S_A@$DEVSHELL_PROJECT_ID.iam.gserviceaccount.com --role roles/monitoring.metricWriter

gcloud projects add-iam-policy-binding $DEVSHELL_PROJECT_ID --member serviceAccount:$S_A@$DEVSHELL_PROJECT_ID.iam.gserviceaccount.com --role roles/logging.logWriter

gcloud projects add-iam-policy-binding $DEVSHELL_PROJECT_ID --member serviceAccount:$S_A@$DEVSHELL_PROJECT_ID.iam.gserviceaccount.com --role projects/$DEVSHELL_PROJECT_ID/roles/$CUSTOM_ROLE
```

- **Monitoring Viewer**: Allows the service account to view monitoring data.
- **Monitoring Metric Writer**: Enables writing monitoring data.
- **Logging Writer**: Grants permission to write logs.
- **Custom Role**: Grants additional permissions defined in your custom role.

## Create Kubernetes Cluster

Create a Kubernetes cluster using the service account. This command includes options for enabling private nodes and a private endpoint for increased security.

```bash
gcloud container clusters create $CLUSTER --num-nodes 1 --master-ipv4-cidr=172.16.0.64/28 --network orca-build-vpc --subnetwork orca-build-subnet --enable-master-authorized-networks --master-authorized-networks 192.168.10.2/32 --enable-ip-alias --enable-private-nodes --enable-private-endpoint --service-account $S_A@$DEVSHELL_PROJECT_ID.iam.gserviceaccount.com --zone $ZONE
```

- **Private Nodes**: Nodes that do not have external IP addresses.
- **Private Endpoint**: Restricts access to the Kubernetes API server.
- **Service Account**: Specifies which service account the cluster will use.

## Deploy Application

SSH into the jumphost and deploy a sample application. This command sets the zone, retrieves credentials for the Kubernetes cluster, installs necessary tools, and creates a deployment.

```bash
gcloud compute ssh --zone "$ZONE" "orca-jumphost" --project "$DEVSHELL_PROJECT_ID" --quiet --command "gcloud config set compute/zone $ZONE && gcloud container clusters get-credentials $CLUSTER --internal-ip && sudo apt-get install google-cloud-sdk-gke-gcloud-auth-plugin -y && kubectl create deployment hello-server --image=gcr.io/google-samples/hello-app:1.0 && kubectl expose deployment hello-server --name orca-hello-service --type LoadBalancer --port 80 --target-port 8080"
```

- **SSH into Jumphost**: Connects to the jumphost instance.
- **Get Credentials**: Configures `kubectl` to use the new cluster.
- **Deploy Application**: Creates a sample application and exposes it via a LoadBalancer.

## Conclusion

By following these steps, you will have set up a secure cloud environment on Google Cloud with custom roles and service accounts, allowing for controlled access to resources while deploying applications on Kubernetes.
