# Terraform AWS Web Server Setup

This Terraform configuration file provisions an AWS EC2 instance (a web server) with the following components:

- Fetches an existing security group, VPC, and subnet by ID.
- Deploys an Ubuntu-based EC2 instance.
- Configures the EC2 instance with a basic Apache web server.
- Downloads a sample website template from an external URL.
- Configures the Apache server to serve the downloaded template.

## Prerequisites

Before using this Terraform configuration, ensure that you have the following:

- An AWS account with sufficient permissions.
- Terraform installed on your local machine. You can install it from [here](https://www.terraform.io/downloads.html).
- AWS CLI configured with access keys to authenticate Terraform with AWS. You can configure the CLI using `aws configure`.

## Configuration Breakdown

### AWS Provider Configuration

```hcl
provider "aws" {
  region = "us-east-1"  # Change this to your preferred region
}
```

This block specifies the AWS provider and the region where your resources will be deployed. Modify the `region` attribute if you're deploying in a different AWS region.

### Data Sources

Terraform `data` blocks allow you to retrieve information about existing resources in your AWS account. This configuration fetches the following resources:

#### Fetch Existing Security Group

```hcl
data "aws_security_group" "existing_sg" {
  id = "sg-0b26732d61ff73eeb"  # Your specified security group ID
}
```

This block retrieves an existing security group by its ID. Replace `"sg-0b26732d61ff73eeb"` with the ID of your own security group.

#### Fetch Existing VPC

```hcl
data "aws_vpc" "existing_vpc" {
  id = "vpc-0761218dfba564d47"  # Your specified VPC ID
}
```

This block retrieves an existing VPC by its ID. Replace `"vpc-0761218dfba564d47"` with the ID of your own VPC.

#### Fetch Existing Subnet

```hcl
data "aws_subnet" "existing_subnet" {
  id = "subnet-07da3c448c4a45825"  # Your specified subnet ID
}
```

This block retrieves an existing subnet by its ID. Replace `"subnet-07da3c448c4a45825"` with the ID of your own subnet.

### AWS EC2 Instance Resource

```hcl
resource "aws_instance" "web_server" {
  ami           = "ami-084568db4383264d4"  # Ubuntu 20.04 AMI (change based on region)
  instance_type = "t2.micro"
  key_name      = "keypair-new"  # Replace with your SSH key name

  vpc_security_group_ids = [data.aws_security_group.existing_sg.id]
  subnet_id             = data.aws_subnet.existing_subnet.id

  user_data = <<-EOT
              #!/bin/bash
              apt-get update -y
              apt-get install -y apache2 wget unzip

              # Start and enable Apache
              systemctl start apache2
              systemctl enable apache2

              # Download your HTML/CSS files
              wget https://www.tooplate.com/zip-templates/2126_antique_cafe.zip -O /tmp/2126_antique_cafe.zip

              # Extract the ZIP file
              unzip /tmp/2126_antique_cafe.zip -d /tmp/

              # Move extracted files to the Apache web directory
              mv /tmp/2126_antique_cafe/* /var/www/html/

              # Set proper permissions
              chown -R www-data:www-data /var/www/html/

              # Restart Apache to apply changes
              systemctl restart apache2
              EOT

  tags = {
    Name = "WebServer"
  }
}
```

This block provisions an EC2 instance with the following:

- **AMI**: An Ubuntu 20.04 AMI is used. You may need to update this ID based on the region.
- **Instance Type**: The instance type is set to `t2.micro`. Change this if you need a different instance size.
- **SSH Key**: Replace `"keypair-new"` with the name of your own SSH key for secure access to the instance.
- **Security Group**: The EC2 instance is attached to the existing security group that you provided earlier.
- **Subnet**: The EC2 instance is launched in the specified subnet.
- **User Data**: This script runs on first boot to:
  - Install Apache2 web server.
  - Download and extract a sample website template.
  - Move the extracted files into the Apache serverâ€™s root directory.
  - Restart Apache to serve the new files.

### Output

```hcl
output "instance_public_ip" {
  value = aws_instance.web_server.public_ip
}
```

This block outputs the public IP address of the created EC2 instance. You can use this IP to access the web server from your browser.

## Usage

1. **Clone this repository** (or copy the `main.tf` file into your own Terraform project).

2. **Initialize Terraform** by running:

   ```bash
   terraform init
   ```

   This will download the necessary provider plugins and set up the working environment.

3. **Validate the Terraform configuration**:

   ```bash
   terraform validate
   ```

4. **Plan the deployment** to see what Terraform will create:

   ```bash
   terraform plan
   ```

5. **Apply the configuration** to deploy the resources:

   ```bash
   terraform apply
   ```

   Confirm the action when prompted. Terraform will begin provisioning the EC2 instance, security group, subnet, and other resources.

6. After the deployment is complete, Terraform will output the public IP address of the web server.

7. **Access the Web Server**: Open your web browser and navigate to the public IP address of the instance to view the deployed website.

## Cleanup

To remove the deployed resources, run:

```bash
terraform destroy
```

Confirm the destruction when prompted. This will delete the EC2 instance, security group, and other resources created by this Terraform configuration.

## Customization

- **Security Group**: If you need to create a new security group instead of using an existing one, modify the security group block and the associated rules.
- **AMI**: Update the AMI ID based on the AWS region you're using. You can find the correct AMI for Ubuntu 20.04 in the AWS EC2 console.
- **Web Template**: If you wish to serve a different website template, change the `wget` URL in the `user_data` script to the URL of your preferred template.
