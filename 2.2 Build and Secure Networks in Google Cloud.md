# Build and Secure Networks in Google Cloud: Challenge Lab Solution GSP322

## Overview
This guide provides a step-by-step solution to configure a secure environment in Google Cloud, ensuring appropriate firewall rules and virtual machine tags are set up. The focus is on securing access to the bastion host and the application.

## Challenge Requirements
- The bastion host must not have a public IP address.
- SSH access to the bastion host must only be available via Identity-Aware Proxy (IAP).
- SSH access to the juice-shop application must be routed through the bastion host.
- Only HTTP access (port 80) should be open to the internet for the juice-shop application.

## Solution Steps

### Task 1: Check and Remove Overly Permissive Firewall Rules
1. Navigate to **VPC network** > **Firewall** in the Google Cloud Console.
2. Identify and delete the `open-access` rule using the following command:
   ```bash
   gcloud compute firewall-rules delete open-access
   ```

### Task 2: Start the Bastion Host
1. Go to **Compute Engine** > **VM Instances**.
2. Select the bastion host instance (ensure it is stopped).
3. Click on **Start** to boot the instance.

### Task 3: Create Firewall Rule for SSH via IAP
1. Create a firewall rule that allows SSH (tcp/22) from the IAP service. Replace `<SSH IAP network tag>` with the appropriate tag.
   ```bash
   gcloud compute firewall-rules create <SSH_IAP_network_tag> --allow=tcp:22 --source-ranges 35.235.240.0/20 --target-tags <SSH_IAP_network_tag> --network acme-vpc
   ```
2. Add the tag to the bastion host:
   ```bash
   gcloud compute instances add-tags bastion --tags=<SSH_IAP_network_tag> --zone=us-central1-b
   ```

### Task 4: Create Firewall Rule for HTTP Access to Juice-Shop
1. Create a firewall rule for HTTP access. Replace `<HTTP network tag>` with the appropriate tag.
   ```bash
   gcloud compute firewall-rules create <HTTP_network_tag> --allow=tcp:80 --source-ranges 0.0.0.0/0 --target-tags <HTTP_network_tag> --network acme-vpc
   ```
2. Add the tag to the juice-shop instance:
   ```bash
   gcloud compute instances add-tags juice-shop --tags=<HTTP_network_tag> --zone=us-central1-b
   ```

### Task 5: Create Firewall Rule for SSH Access from Management Subnet
1. Create a firewall rule for SSH access from the management subnet. Replace `<SSH internal network tag>` with the appropriate tag.
   ```bash
   gcloud compute firewall-rules create <SSH_internal_network_tag> --allow=tcp:22 --source-ranges 192.168.10.0/24 --target-tags <SSH_internal_network_tag> --network acme-vpc
   ```
2. Add the tag to the juice-shop instance:
   ```bash
   gcloud compute instances add-tags juice-shop --tags=<SSH_internal_network_tag> --zone=us-central1-b
   ```

### Task 6: Accessing Instances
1. SSH into the bastion host using IAP.
   - Navigate to **Compute Engine** > **VM Instances**.
   - Click on **SSH** next to the bastion host.
   
2. SSH into the juice-shop application via the bastion host using its internal IP:
   ```bash
   ssh <internal_IP_of_juice-shop>
   ```

## Conclusion
Following these steps ensures that your Google Cloud environment is secured according to the challenge requirements. By setting specific firewall rules and using tags effectively, you can control access to your resources while minimizing exposure to the internet.
