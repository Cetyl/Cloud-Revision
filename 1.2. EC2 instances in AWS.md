# Amazon EC2 Deep Dive

## What is Amazon EC2?

Amazon EC2 (Elastic Compute Cloud) is a web service that provides secure, resizable compute capacity in the cloud. It is designed to make web-scale cloud computing easier for developers. 

EC2 allows you to launch as many or as few virtual servers (called instances) as you need, configure security and networking, and manage storage. You can use these instances to scale up or down depending on your computing requirements.

## Key Features of EC2

- **Scalability** - You can increase or decrease the compute capacity within minutes to handle changes in your computing requirements.
- **Reliability** - EC2 is built around multiple, isolated placement groups and Availability Zones, which provides high availability and fault tolerance.
- **Flexibility** - EC2 offers a wide range of instance types optimized to different use cases like CPU-intensive or memory-intensive applications. You pay only for what you use.
- **Global Infrastructure** - Amazon has data centers globally and EC2 provides resources in all regions to deploy applications close to users.
- **Security** - EC2 provides security groups for network access control and firewall, along with other security features like encryption, IAM roles etc.
- **Management Tools** - EC2 integrates with other AWS services like S3, EBS, ELB etc. It offers command line tools and APIs to automate deployment and management of instances.

## Types of EC2 Instances

EC2 provides different types of instances optimized for various applications:

- **General Purpose** - Balance of compute, memory and networking resources for many workloads. (M, M5, T3 families).

- **Compute Optimized** - High performance processors for compute-intensive tasks like batch processing (C, C5 families). 

- **Memory Optimized** - Large amounts of memory for memory intensive tasks like data crunching (R, X, Z1 families).

- **Accelerated Computing** - Use GPUs/FPGAs to accelerate applications (P, F families). 

- **Storage Optimized** - High sequential read/write access for big data apps (H, I families).

- **Deployment Options** - On-Demand (pay by hour), Reserved (upfront payment), Spot (discount) instances.

## Launching and Managing EC2 Instances

To launch EC2 instances, you need to:

- Choose an AMI (Amazon Machine Image) which has the OS and application software pre-installed.

- Select instance type based on your requirements.

- Configure security group to open or close ports as needed. 

- Specify a key pair for SSH access to the instance.

- Launch into an Availability Zone for high availability. 

You can launch, terminate, stop, start, reboot instances from the EC2 console or using command line tools/SDKs. You can also connect to instances over SSH.

EBS volumes provide persistent block level storage that can be attached to instances for data storage. Elastic IP addresses allow static public IPs. Load balancers distribute traffic across instances. Auto Scaling scales resources automatically based on demand.

That covers some of the key aspects of Amazon EC2 in a nutshell. It provides a scalable, reliable and secure cloud computing platform to deploy applications and handle varying workloads.
