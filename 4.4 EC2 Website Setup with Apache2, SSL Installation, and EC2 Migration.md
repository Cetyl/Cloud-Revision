 
# EC2 Website Setup with Apache2, SSL Installation, and EC2 Migration


## **Prerequisites**

- Two AWS accounts (Account A and Account B).
- A registered domain name and access to DNS configuration.
- Basic knowledge of Linux and AWS EC2.
- EC2 instance launched and running (preferably Ubuntu).
- Security Groups configured to allow HTTP (80), HTTPS (443), and SSH (22) traffic.

---

## **1. Launch EC2 Instance (Account A)**

1. **Login to AWS Console (Account A):**
   - Open the [AWS Management Console](https://aws.amazon.com/console/).
   - In the EC2 Dashboard, click **Launch Instance**.

2. **Select the Operating System:**
   - Choose an appropriate Linux-based AMI (Amazon Machine Image), such as **Ubuntu 20.04**.

3. **Instance Type:**
   - Choose an instance type (e.g., **t2.micro** for low-cost testing purposes).

4. **Configure Instance:**
   - Configure network settings, storage, and other options based on your requirements.

5. **Security Group Configuration:**
   - Ensure the security group allows traffic on ports 80 (HTTP), 443 (HTTPS), and 22 (SSH) for administrative access.

6. **Launch the Instance:**
   - Once configured, launch the instance and download the SSH key pair.

---

## **2. Install Apache2 on EC2 Instance (Account A)**

1. **Connect to EC2 Instance:**

   ```bash
   ssh -i /path/to/your-key.pem ubuntu@your-ec2-public-ip
   ```

2. **Install Apache2:**

   ```bash
   sudo apt update
   sudo apt install apache2 -y
   ```

3. **Check Apache2 Status:**

   ```bash
   sudo systemctl status apache2
   ```

   Apache2 should now be installed and running.

4. **Configure Firewall to Allow HTTP/HTTPS Traffic:**

   ```bash
   sudo ufw allow in "Apache Full"
   ```

5. **Create a Virtual Host for Your Website:**

   - Navigate to Apache's `sites-available` directory:

   ```bash
   cd /etc/apache2/sites-available/
   ```

   - Create a new file for your domain (replace `yourdomain.com` with your actual domain):

   ```bash
   sudo nano yourdomain.com.conf
   ```

   - Add the following content, adjusting the `DocumentRoot` path and domain name accordingly:

   ```apache
   <VirtualHost *:80>
       ServerAdmin webmaster@localhost
       ServerName yourdomain.com
       DocumentRoot /var/www/yourdomain.com
       ErrorLog ${APACHE_LOG_DIR}/error.log
       CustomLog ${APACHE_LOG_DIR}/access.log combined
   </VirtualHost>
   ```

   - Enable the site and reload Apache2:

   ```bash
   sudo a2ensite yourdomain.com.conf
   sudo systemctl reload apache2
   ```

6. **Create Your Website's Directory:**

   ```bash
   sudo mkdir /var/www/yourdomain.com
   sudo nano /var/www/yourdomain.com/index.html
   ```

   Add some basic HTML content to confirm the server is working.

7. **Test Your Website:**
   - Open a browser and navigate to your EC2's public IP or domain name. You should see the Apache2 default page or your own content.

## **3. Install SSL Certificate Using Certbot**

1. **Install Certbot:**

   ```bash
   sudo apt install certbot python3-certbot-apache -y
   ```

2. **Obtain an SSL Certificate:**
   - Run the following command to obtain and install the SSL certificate for your domain:

   ```bash
   sudo certbot --apache -d yourdomain.com -d www.yourdomain.com
   ```

   - Follow the prompts to configure SSL automatically.

3. **Verify SSL Installation:**
   - After the process is complete, verify your SSL installation by visiting `https://yourdomain.com`.
   - You should see a secure HTTPS connection.

4. **Auto-Renewal Configuration:**
   - Certbot automatically sets up a cron job for auto-renewal. You can check this by running:

   ```bash
   sudo systemctl status certbot.timer
   ```

## **4. Migrate EC2 Instance to Another AWS Account (Account B)**

### Step 1: Create an AMI from the EC2 Instance (Account A)

1. **Login to AWS Console (Account A):**
   - Open the **EC2 Dashboard**.
   - Under **Instances**, select your instance.

2. **Create an Image (AMI):**
   - Click **Actions** → **Image and templates** → **Create image**.
   - Provide a name and description for the image, then click **Create Image**.

3. **Wait for AMI Creation:**
   - Once the image creation is complete, you will have an AMI listed in the **AMIs** section.

---

### Step 2: Share AMI with Account B

1. **Share AMI with Account B:**
   - Select the AMI created in the previous step.
   - Click on **Actions** → **Modify Image Permissions**.
   - Select **Private** and enter the Account ID of Account B.
   - Click **Save Changes**.

2. **Login to AWS Console (Account B):**
   - Switch to Account B.
   - Go to the **EC2 Dashboard** → **AMIs** section.
   - You should see the shared AMI listed there.

---

### Step 3: Launch a New EC2 Instance in Account B

1. **Launch EC2 from Shared AMI:**
   - Select the shared AMI and click **Launch**.
   - Choose the instance type, configure instance settings, and ensure that security groups are configured to allow HTTP/HTTPS/SSH traffic.

2. **SSH into the New Instance in Account B:**

   ```bash
   ssh -i /path/to/your-key.pem ubuntu@new-ec2-public-ip
   ```

3. **Verify Website and SSL:**
   - Ensure that the website and SSL certificate are correctly set up by visiting `https://yourdomain.com` from a browser.

4. **Update DNS Settings:**
   - In your domain registrar’s dashboard, update the DNS records to point to the new EC2 public IP.

---

### Step 4: Clean Up in Account A

1. **Terminate the EC2 Instance in Account A:**
   - Once the migration is complete and everything is working, you can terminate the EC2 instance in Account A to avoid additional charges.

2. **Delete AMI from Account A:**
   - Optionally, delete the AMI if no longer required.

---

## **Conclusion**

You have successfully:

1. Set up an EC2 instance in Account A with Apache2.
2. Installed an SSL certificate using Certbot.
3. Migrated the EC2 instance to Account B.

You can now manage your website from Account B, ensuring that all configurations are intact, including your SSL certificate.

---

## **Additional Notes**

- Always backup your EC2 instance before making significant changes.
- Ensure the security group and firewall settings are properly configured to avoid blocking important traffic.
- Regularly check Certbot renewal logs to avoid expired certificates.
