  # Public Cloud with respect to AWS (Amazon Web Services)

Public Cloud, in the context of AWS, refers to a model of cloud computing where IT resources and services are provided over the internet and shared among multiple customers.

## Key Aspects

1. **Shared Infrastructure**
   - AWS owns and manages the hardware, software, and networking infrastructure that supports the services.

2. **On-demand Resources**
   - Customers can quickly provision and scale resources like compute power, storage, and databases as needed.

3. **Pay-as-you-go**
   - Users only pay for the resources they consume, typically billed by the second or minute.

4. **Global Availability**
   - AWS has data centers (called Regions and Availability Zones) around the world, allowing users to deploy resources closer to their end-users.

5. **Broad Set of Services**
   - AWS offers a wide range of services including:
     - Computing (EC2)
     - Storage (S3)
     - Databases (RDS)
     - Machine learning
     - Analytics
     - And more

6. **Managed Services**
   - Many services are fully managed by AWS, reducing the operational burden on customers.

7. **Security and Compliance**
   - AWS provides various security features and complies with numerous industry standards.
   - Customers are responsible for securing their applications and data.

8. **Elasticity**
   - Resources can automatically scale up or down based on demand.

9. **Self-service**
   - Users can provision and manage resources through:
     - Web interfaces
     - APIs
     - Command-line tools

## Comparison

Public cloud contrasts with:
- Private cloud (used by a single organization)
- Hybrid cloud (a mix of public and private)

AWS, along with Microsoft Azure and Google Cloud Platform, is one of the leading public cloud providers globally.
