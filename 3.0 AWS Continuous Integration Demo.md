# AWS Continuous Integration Demo

## Overview
In this demo, we'll set up a CI pipeline for a Python application using GitHub, AWS CodePipeline, and AWS CodeBuild. This will automate the process of building and deploying our application every time we make changes to our code.

## Set Up GitHub Repository

The first step in our CI journey is to set up a GitHub repository to store our Python application's source code. If you already have a repository, feel free to skip this step. Otherwise, follow these instructions:

1. **Sign In**:
   - Go to [github.com](https://github.com) and sign in to your account.

2. **Create New Repository**:
   - Click on the "+" button in the top-right corner and select **"New repository."**

3. **Repository Details**:
   - Give your repository a name (e.g., `my-python-app`) and an optional description.
   - Choose the appropriate visibility option (public or private) based on your needs.

4. **Initialize the Repository**:
   - Check the option to **"Initialize this repository with a README"** to create a README file.

5. **Create Repository**:
   - Click on the **"Create repository"** button to create your new GitHub repository.

## Create an AWS CodePipeline

In this step, we’ll create an AWS CodePipeline to automate the continuous integration process for our Python application. CodePipeline will orchestrate the flow of changes from our GitHub repository to the deployment of our application.

1. **Open AWS Management Console**:
   - Navigate to the [AWS Management Console](https://aws.amazon.com/console/).

2. **Access CodePipeline**:
   - Search for **CodePipeline** in the services and select it.

3. **Create Pipeline**:
   - Click on the **"Create pipeline"** button.

4. **Pipeline Configuration**:
   - Provide a name for your pipeline (e.g., `MyPythonAppPipeline`) and click **"Next."**

5. **Source Stage**:
   - For the source provider, select **GitHub**.
   - Click **"Connect to GitHub"** to authorize AWS CodePipeline to access your GitHub account.
   - Select your repository and the branch you want to use.

6. **Build Stage**:
   - For the build provider, select **AWS CodeBuild**.
   - Create a new CodeBuild project by clicking on the **"Create project"** button.

7. **Configure CodeBuild**:
   - Configure the CodeBuild project settings, including the environment (e.g., Ubuntu, standard runtime), build commands, and artifacts.
   - Example build commands:
     ```bash
     pip install -r requirements.txt
     pytest
     ```

8. **Deployment Stage**:
   - Select a deployment provider (e.g., AWS Elastic Beanstalk, AWS ECS, or AWS Lambda) to deploy your application.

9. **Review and Create**:
   - Review your pipeline configuration and click **"Create pipeline."**

---

## Configure AWS CodeBuild

In this step, we’ll configure AWS CodeBuild to build our Python application based on the specifications we define. CodeBuild will package our application for deployment.

1. **Navigate to CodeBuild**:
   - In the AWS Management Console, search for and select **CodeBuild**.

2. **Create Build Project**:
   - Click on the **"Create build project"** button.

3. **Project Configuration**:
   - Provide a name for your build project (e.g., `MyPythonAppBuild`).
   - For the source provider, select **AWS CodePipeline** and choose the pipeline you created earlier.

4. **Build Environment**:
   - Choose the operating system (e.g., Ubuntu), runtime (e.g., Python), and compute resources for your build.

5. **Build Commands**:
   - Specify the build commands needed to install dependencies and run tests:
     ```bash
     pip install -r requirements.txt
     pytest
     ```

6. **Artifacts Configuration**:
   - Set up the artifacts configuration to specify the output that will be used in the deployment stage.

7. **Create Build Project**:
   - Review your settings and click **"Create build project."**

---

## Trigger the CI Process

In this final step, we’ll trigger the CI process by making a change to our GitHub repository.

1. **Make Changes**:
   - Go to your GitHub repository and make a change to your Python application's source code (e.g., add a new feature or fix a bug).

2. **Commit Changes**:
   - Commit and push your changes to the branch configured in your AWS CodePipeline.

3. **Monitor CodePipeline**:
   - Head over to the **AWS CodePipeline console** and navigate to your pipeline.
   - You should see the pipeline automatically kick off as soon as it detects the changes in your repository.

4. **Watch the Process**:
   - Sit back and relax while AWS CodePipeline fetches the latest code, triggers the build process with AWS CodeBuild, and deploys the application if you configured the deployment stage.

## Conclusion

Congratulations! You’ve successfully set up a continuous integration pipeline for your Python application using GitHub, AWS CodePipeline, and AWS CodeBuild. This setup will help automate the process of building, testing, and deploying your application, making your development workflow more efficient and reliable.

For further exploration, consider integrating more advanced features like automated testing frameworks, notifications via Amazon SNS, and additional stages for quality checks or security scans.
