# Setting up Active Directory on AWS EC2 Windows Server

This guide explains how to set up a basic Active Directory (AD) Domain Controller on an AWS EC2 instance running Windows Server. The domain controller will allow you to manage users, computers, and resources in a centralized way.

## Prerequisites

- An AWS account
- AWS CLI configured (optional)
- A Windows Server instance on AWS EC2
- Basic knowledge of AWS EC2, Active Directory, and Windows Server

## Steps to Setup Active Directory on AWS Windows Server

### Step 1: Launch a Windows Server EC2 Instance

1. Log into your [AWS Management Console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/).
2. Go to **EC2** and click on **Launch Instance**.
3. Choose a Windows Server AMI (e.g., **Microsoft Windows Server 2019 Base**).
4. Select an instance type based on your needs (e.g., `t3.medium`).
5. Configure instance details as needed (for basic setup, you can leave most options as default).
6. Add storage if required (default is typically sufficient).
7. Configure security group:
    - Open port `3389` for RDP (Remote Desktop Protocol) to connect to the instance.
    - Open port `53` (UDP and TCP) for DNS if needed.
    - Open port `88` (UDP and TCP) for Kerberos authentication.
    - Open port `389` (UDP and TCP) for LDAP.
8. Review and launch the instance.

### Step 2: Connect to the Windows Server Instance

Once the instance is running, connect to it via RDP:

1. In the EC2 Dashboard, select your instance and click **Connect**.
2. Follow the instructions to download the RDP file and retrieve the password.

### Step 3: Install Active Directory Domain Services

1. Once connected to your Windows Server instance, open the **Server Manager**.
2. Click on **Add roles and features**.
3. In the wizard:
    - Click **Next** until you reach the **Select features** page.
    - Select **Active Directory Domain Services (AD DS)**.
    - Click **Next** and then **Install**. Wait for the installation to complete.

### Step 4: Promote the Server to a Domain Controller

1. Once the installation completes, a notification will appear in the Server Manager. Click on the **Promote this server to a domain controller** link.
2. In the **Deployment Configuration** window:
    - Select **Add a new forest**.
    - Enter your desired **Root domain name** (e.g., `example.com`).
3. In the **Domain Controller Options** window:
    - Set a **Directory Services Restore Mode (DSRM) password** (make sure to remember it).
    - Select default values for the rest of the options (ensure that DNS server is installed).
4. In the **Additional Options** window, leave the default **NetBIOS name** or change it if needed.
5. In the **Paths** window, leave the default values for database, log files, and SYSVOL folder locations.
6. In the **Review Options** window, check the configurations and click **Next**.
7. In the **Prerequisites Check** window, ensure all checks are passed and click **Install**.
8. The server will automatically reboot.

### Step 5: Configure Active Directory

After the server reboots and Active Directory is set up:

1. Log in using the **Administrator** account (e.g., `Administrator@example.com`).
2. Open **Active Directory Users and Computers** (available in Server Manager or by typing `dsa.msc` in the Run dialog).
3. From here, you can start creating organizational units (OUs), user accounts, groups, and more.

### Step 6: Verifying DNS Configuration

For Active Directory to function correctly, the DNS server must be properly configured. Ensure that your EC2 instance is using itself as the DNS server:

1. Open the **Network and Sharing Center**.
2. Click on **Change adapter settings**.
3. Right-click your network adapter and select **Properties**.
4. Select **Internet Protocol Version 4 (TCP/IPv4)** and click **Properties**.
5. Set the DNS server to the **local IP address** of the server (e.g., `127.0.0.1` or the server's private IP address).
6. Click **OK** to apply the changes.

### Step 7: Test Active Directory Domain Controller

1. From the server, open **Command Prompt** and run the following commands:
   - Check the domain status:  
     ```bash
     nltest /dsgetdc:example.com
     ```
   - Check DNS functionality:
     ```bash
     nslookup example.com
     ```
   - Test Kerberos authentication:
     ```bash
     klist
     ```

2. You can also try joining another machine to the domain.

### Step 8: Optional - Configure EC2 Security Group for AD Access

Ensure that other instances in the same VPC (Virtual Private Cloud) can communicate with your AD server by configuring appropriate inbound/outbound rules in the security group. At a minimum, allow:
- Port `389` (LDAP)
- Port `636` (LDAPS)
- Port `53` (DNS)

### Step 9: Backing Up Active Directory

It is important to back up your Active Directory configuration to avoid data loss in case of server failure.

1. In **Server Manager**, go to **Tools > Windows Server Backup**.
2. Create a backup plan or manually back up the system state.

## Conclusion

You've successfully set up an Active Directory Domain Controller on a Windows Server instance hosted on AWS EC2. From here, you can manage user accounts, group policies, and other domain-related services.
