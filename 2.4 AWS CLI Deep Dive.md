## Introduction

The AWS Command Line Interface (CLI) is a unified tool that allows you to manage your AWS services from the command line. With the AWS CLI, you can control multiple AWS services and automate them through scripts.

## What is AWS CLI?

AWS CLI is a command-line tool that allows you to interact with AWS services using commands in your command-line shell. It is built on top of the AWS SDKs and provides an easy-to-use interface for various AWS services.

### Key Features:
- **Cross-Platform**: Works on Windows, macOS, and Linux.
- **Unified Interface**: Use the same commands across different services.
- **Scripting Support**: Easily script your AWS tasks.

## Installation

### Requirements

- Python 3.6 or later
- pip (Python package installer)

### Installation Steps

#### Using pip

1. **Open your terminal** (Command Prompt, PowerShell, Terminal, etc.).
2. **Install the AWS CLI** by running:
   ```bash
   pip install awscli --upgrade --user
   ```
3. **Verify the installation**:
   ```bash
   aws --version
   ```

#### Alternative Installation (Windows)

   ```
2. Enter your AWS Access Key ID, Secret Access Key, default region name, and output format when prompted.

### Example Configuration
```

AWS Secret Access Key [None]: YOUR_SECRET_KEY
Default region name [None]: us-east-1
Default output format [None]: json
```

## Basic Commands

Here are a few basic commands you can run with the AWS CLI:

- **List S3 Buckets**:
  ```bash
  aws s3 ls
  ```

- **Describe EC2 Instances**:
  ```bash
  aws ec2 describe-instances
  ```

- **Create a new S3 bucket**:
  ```bash
  aws s3 mb s3://your-bucket-name
  ```

## Demo

### Demo Setup

In this demo, we will perform the following actions:
1. Create an S3 bucket.
2. Upload a file to the S3 bucket.
3. List the contents of the bucket.
4. Delete the file and the bucket.

### Executing Commands

1. **Create an S3 bucket**:
   ```bash
   aws s3 mb s3://my-demo-bucket-123456
   ```

2. **Upload a file** (ensure you have a file named `example.txt`):
   ```bash
   aws s3 cp example.txt s3://my-demo-bucket-123456/
   ```

3. **List the contents of the bucket**:
   ```bash
   aws s3 ls s3://my-demo-bucket-123456/
   ```

4. **Delete the file from the bucket**:
   ```bash
   aws s3 rm s3://my-demo-bucket-123456/example.txt
   ```

5. **Delete the bucket**:
   ```bash
   aws s3 rb s3://my-demo-bucket-123456 --force
   ```
