### 1. **Navigate to the Amazon Lightsail Console**
   - Open the [Amazon Lightsail console](https://lightsail.aws.amazon.com/) in your web browser.

### 2. **Select the Databases Tab**
   - In the Lightsail dashboard, find and click on the **Databases** tab to get to the database creation page.

### 3. **Choose Create Database**
   - Click on **Create database** to start the database creation process.

### 4. **Select Region and Availability Zone**
   - You will be prompted to choose the AWS Region and Availability Zone where your database will be hosted. This is important to ensure your database is placed in the correct location based on your needs.

### 5. **Select Your Database Type (MySQL or PostgreSQL)**
   - Lightsail currently supports **MySQL** and **PostgreSQL**. For this tutorial, select **MySQL** and choose the latest available version.

### 6. **Specify Login Credentials**
   - You can either create a custom database username (like `dbmasteruser`) or leave it blank to use the default username once the database is deployed.

### 7. **Set a Password**
   - By default, Lightsail generates a strong password. However, you can uncheck the option "Create a strong password for me" and enter your own password, such as `Sunny2DAY!`.

### 8. **Name Your Database**
   - You need to give your database a name. For this tutorial, enter `main`. This will result in a database named `dbmain` being created on your instance.

### 9. **Choose a Database Plan (Standard or High Availability)**
   - You can choose between:
     - **Standard Plan**: The most common and cost-effective choice. Select the **$15 USD Standard plan** for this tutorial.
     - **High Availability Plan**: More expensive but ensures greater uptime by providing redundancy.

### 10. **Name Your Database Instance**
   - Enter a name for the database instance (server). For example, `DB-Instance-1`. This is how your MySQL server will be identified in the Lightsail console.

### 11. **Create the Database**
   - Click **Create database** to start the deployment. It will take around **10-15 minutes** for the database to be provisioned.

### 12. **Deploy a Lightsail Ubuntu Instance (Optional, for Database Management)**
   - While waiting for the database, navigate back to the **Instances** page by selecting the **Lightsail** icon or **Home** button.
   - Click **Create instance** to deploy an Ubuntu instance that will act as your management host.

### 13. **Select the Region for Your Instance**
   - Make sure to select the same Region as your database to ensure they can communicate.

### 14. **Choose OS Only and Ubuntu Blueprint**
   - Under **Select a blueprint**, choose **OS Only** and then select **Ubuntu** (latest version).

### 15. **Add Launch Script to Install MySQL Client**
   - Add a **Launch Script** that will automatically install the MySQL client on the instance. Paste the following code:

     ```bash
     sudo apt update
     sudo apt-get install mysql-client-core-8.0 -y
     ```

### 16. **Choose an Instance Plan**
   - Select the **$3.50 USD per month** plan for a small, cost-effective instance. Larger plans may be selected based on your projectâ€™s requirements.

### 17. **Name Your Instance**
   - Enter a name for your instance, such as `Ubuntu-1`, then click **Create instance**.

### 18. **Wait for Database Instance to Be Available**
   - You can monitor the progress in the **Databases** tab in the Lightsail console. Once the status is no longer "Creating," the database is ready.

### 19. **Access Your Database Instance**
   - After the database is available, click on the instance name to access its details. You will find the database **Endpoint** and **Port**.

### 20. **Review Instance Information**
   - On the database instance page, you will see important information such as the **MySQL version**, **Region**, **Endpoint**, **Port**, and your **username/password** to connect.

### 21. **Enable Logs**
   - Go to the **Logs & history** tab, enable logs by toggling the switches. These logs are useful for troubleshooting.

### 22. **View Logs**
   - After enabling logs, click **Open log** to review the logs and troubleshoot as necessary.

### 23. **Review Metrics**
   - On the **Metrics** tab, you can view graphical representations of resource usage (CPU, memory, etc.) to monitor the performance of your database.

### 24. **Networking Configuration**
   - In the **Networking** tab, avoid enabling **Public mode** unless absolutely necessary, as it exposes your database to the internet. Public mode should only be enabled temporarily for troubleshooting.

### 25. **Create Database Snapshots**
   - In the **Snapshots & restore** tab, you can create manual snapshots of your database. Lightsail also creates automatic backups every 5 minutes.

### 26. **Create a Snapshot**
   - To create a snapshot, click **Create snapshot** and name it, for example, `DB-Instance-1-Fresh-Deployment`.

### 27. **Restore from Snapshot**
   - If you need to restore from a snapshot, click the **three-dot menu** next to the snapshot and select the option to create a new database from it.

### 28. **Connect to MySQL from Your Ubuntu Instance**
   - Copy the **database endpoint** and SSH into your **Ubuntu-1** instance.
   - Run the following command, replacing `DATABASE_URL` with the endpoint you copied earlier:

     ```bash
     mysql -h DATABASE_URL -u dbmasteruser -pSunny2DAY!
     ```

### 29. **List Databases**
   - Once connected, list the databases by running:

     ```sql
     SHOW DATABASES;
     ```

   - You should see `dbmain` and other system databases.

### 30. **Create a New Database**
   - Create a new database by running:

     ```sql
     CREATE DATABASE secondDB;
     ```

### 31. **Grant Privileges**
   - Grant the `dbmasteruser` user all privileges on the new database:

     ```sql
     GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON secondDB.* TO 'dbmasteruser'@'%';
     ```

### 32. **Exit MySQL Session**
   - After finishing, exit the MySQL session by typing:

     ```sql
     exit;
     ```

---

### Conclusion

By following these steps, you have successfully deployed and configured a MySQL database instance on Amazon Lightsail. You also learned how to connect to it, create new databases, manage privileges, and take snapshots of your database for backup or recovery purposes.
