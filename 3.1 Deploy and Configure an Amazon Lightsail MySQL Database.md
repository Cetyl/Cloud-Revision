# MySQL Database Setup on Amazon Lightsail

This repository contains a step-by-step guide to deploying and configuring a MySQL database instance using Amazon Lightsail. It covers setting up a Lightsail MySQL database, creating a database, connecting to it remotely, and managing it with basic administrative tasks.

### Prerequisites
Before starting, make sure you have the following:

- An AWS account with access to Amazon Lightsail.
- Basic knowledge of MySQL and how to work with relational databases.
- SSH access to your Lightsail instances (for remote management).

### Step 1: Navigate to Amazon Lightsail Console
1. Go to the [Amazon Lightsail Console](https://lightsail.aws.amazon.com).
2. Click on the **Databases** tab to start setting up your database.

---

### Step 2: Create a MySQL Database Instance
1. Click **Create database**.
2. Choose the **MySQL** engine, and select the latest version.
3. Set the Region and Availability Zone where you want your database to reside.
4. Specify login credentials. You can either create a new username or use the default.
5. Choose a password for your database instance (e.g., `password`).
6. Name your database (e.g., `main`), which will be created as `dbmain` on the instance.
7. Choose the **Standard Plan** ($15 USD/month) for a single-server database.
8. Name your database instance (e.g., `DB-Instance-1`).
9. Click **Create database** and wait for the instance to be deployed (approximately 10â€“15 minutes).

---

### Step 3: Create an Ubuntu Instance for Management
While waiting for your database to be deployed:

1. Navigate back to the **Instances** page and click **Create instance**.
2. Select **OS Only**, then choose **Ubuntu** (latest version).
3. Choose a $3.50 USD instance plan (small, cost-effective).
4. Add a Launch Script to install the MySQL client on your instance:
    ```bash
    sudo apt update
    sudo apt-get install mysql-client-core-8.0 -y
    ```
5. Name your instance (e.g., `Ubuntu-1`), and click **Create instance**.
6. Once the Ubuntu instance is deployed, you can use it to connect to your Lightsail MySQL database instance.

---

### Step 4: Connect to the MySQL Database
Once your database is deployed:

1. Go back to the **Databases** tab in Lightsail.
2. Copy the **Endpoint** and **Port** for your MySQL instance.
3. SSH into your **Ubuntu-1** instance.
4. Use the following command to connect to your MySQL database:
    ```bash
    mysql -h DATABASE_URL -u dbmasteruser -p'password'
    ```
    Replace `DATABASE_URL` with the endpoint you copied earlier.

---

### Step 5: Manage the Database
Once connected to MySQL, you can perform administrative tasks such as:

- **List Databases**:
    ```sql
    SHOW DATABASES;
    ```

- **Create a New Database**:
    ```sql
    CREATE DATABASE secondDB;
    ```

- **Grant Privileges to a User**:
    ```sql
    GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON secondDB.* TO 'dbmasteruser'@'%';
    ```

- **Exit MySQL**:
    ```sql
    exit;
    ```

Additionally, you can manage your database through the Lightsail console:

- **Snapshots & Restore**: Create backups of your database.
- **Metrics**: Monitor the performance of your database.
- **Logs**: Enable and view database logs for troubleshooting.

---

### Additional MySQL Commands

Here are a few additional commands that might be helpful in managing your MySQL database:

1. **Connect to your MySQL instance remotely as root user** using a specific user:
    ```bash
    mysql -h DATABASE_URL -u masteruser -p'testaccountdb'
    ```

2. **Create a new MySQL user**:
    ```sql
    CREATE USER 'newuser'@'%' IDENTIFIED BY 'password';
    ```
3. **Give permissions for the created user**:
   ```bash
   GRANT SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE ON `ABMCPL-AW-GMLP-UAT-DBA-01`.* TO 'newuser'@'%';
   ```
4. **Flush Privileges**:
    ```bash
    FLUSH PRIVILEGES;
    ```
5. **Connect as the new user in bash after logging out**:
    ```bash
    mysql -h DATABASE_URL -u newuser -p'password'
    ```

6. **Check the current MySQL user**:
    ```sql
    SELECT USER();
    ```

### Conclusion
Congratulations! You've successfully deployed a MySQL database instance using Amazon Lightsail, connected to it via an Ubuntu instance, and learned how to perform basic administrative tasks.

---

### Next Steps

- Scale your Lightsail instance if needed.
- Set up automatic backups and monitoring.
- Connect your MySQL database to an application (e.g., a website or API).
