# MySQL Database Setup on Amazon Lightsail

This repository contains a step-by-step guide to deploying and configuring a MySQL database instance using **Amazon Lightsail**. It covers setting up a Lightsail MySQL database, creating a database, connecting to it remotely, and managing it with basic administrative tasks.

## Prerequisites

Before starting, make sure you have the following:

- An **AWS** account with access to Amazon Lightsail.
- Basic knowledge of MySQL and how to work with relational databases.
- **SSH access** to your Lightsail instances (for remote management).

## Step 1: Navigate to Amazon Lightsail Console

1. Go to the [Amazon Lightsail Console](https://lightsail.aws.amazon.com/).
2. Click on the **Databases** tab to start setting up your database.

---

## Step 2: Create a MySQL Database Instance

1. Click **Create database**.
2. Choose the **MySQL** engine, and select the latest version.
3. Set the **Region** and **Availability Zone** where you want your database to reside.
4. Specify login credentials. You can either create a new username or use the default.
5. Choose a password for your database instance (e.g., `Sunny2DAY!`).
6. Name your database (e.g., `main`), which will be created as `dbmain` on the instance.
7. Choose the **Standard Plan** ($15 USD/month) for a single-server database.
8. Name your database instance (e.g., `DB-Instance-1`).
9. Click **Create database** and wait for the instance to be deployed (around 10â€“15 minutes).

---

## Step 3: Create an Ubuntu Instance for Management

While waiting for your database to be deployed:

1. Navigate back to the **Instances** page and click **Create instance**.
2. Select **OS Only**, then choose **Ubuntu** (latest version).
3. Choose a **$3.50 USD** instance plan (small, cost-effective).
4. Add a **Launch Script** to install the MySQL client on your instance:
   ```bash
   sudo apt update
   sudo apt-get install mysql-client-core-8.0 -y
   ```
5. Name your instance (e.g., `Ubuntu-1`), and click **Create instance**.

Once the Ubuntu instance is deployed, you can use it to connect to your Lightsail MySQL database instance.

---

## Step 4: Connect to the MySQL Database

1. Once your database is deployed, go back to the **Databases** tab in Lightsail.
2. Copy the **Endpoint** and **Port** for your MySQL instance.
3. SSH into your **Ubuntu-1** instance.
4. Use the following command to connect to your MySQL database:
   ```bash
   mysql -h DATABASE_URL -u dbmasteruser -p 'Sunny2DAY!'
   ```
   Replace `DATABASE_URL` with the endpoint you copied earlier.

---

## Step 5: Manage the Database

Once connected to MySQL, you can perform administrative tasks such as:

- **List Databases**:
  ```sql
  SHOW DATABASES;
  ```

- **Create a New Database**:
  ```sql
  CREATE DATABASE secondDB;
  ```

- **Grant Privileges to a User**:
  ```sql
  GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON secondDB.* TO 'dbmasteruser'@'%';
  ```

- **Exit MySQL**:
  ```sql
  exit;
  ```

Additionally, you can manage your database through the **Lightsail console**:
- **Snapshots & Restore**: Create backups of your database.
- **Metrics**: Monitor the performance of your database.
- **Logs**: Enable and view database logs for troubleshooting.

## Conclusion

Congratulations! You've successfully deployed a MySQL database instance using Amazon Lightsail, connected to it via an Ubuntu instance, and learned how to perform basic administrative tasks.

### Next Steps

- Scale your Lightsail instance if needed.
- Set up automatic backups and monitoring.
- Connect your MySQL database to an application (e.g., a website or API).
