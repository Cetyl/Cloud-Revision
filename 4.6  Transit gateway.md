# AWS Transit Gateway (TGW)

## Overview

**AWS Transit Gateway (TGW)** is a highly scalable and centralized hub that simplifies connectivity between Amazon VPCs (Virtual Private Clouds), on-premises networks, and other AWS services. Instead of creating point-to-point connections between each network, you can connect them all through a single gateway ‚Äì the Transit Gateway.

This hub-and-spoke model streamlines network management, improves scalability, and reduces operational overhead.

## üß† How It Works

Transit Gateway acts like a central router that can connect multiple VPCs and VPNs. When a packet arrives at the Transit Gateway, it examines the **route tables** to determine where to forward the packet.

### Key Components

- **Transit Gateway (TGW):** The central router.
- **Attachments:** Resources connected to TGW (VPCs, VPNs, Direct Connect, etc.)
- **Route Tables:** Control how traffic is routed between attachments.
- **Propagation:** Automatically inserts routes from attachments into TGW route tables.
- **Peering:** Connects TGWs across different AWS Regions.

## üîÅ Routing and Attachments

### 1. **VPC Attachments**
   - Each VPC is attached to TGW using a **VPC attachment**.
   - AWS creates **Elastic Network Interfaces (ENIs)** in the VPC subnets for traffic flow.
   - VPC route tables must point to the TGW for inter-VPC communication.

### 2. **VPN and Direct Connect Attachments**
   - On-premises networks connect via VPN or Direct Connect attachments.
   - VPN connections use BGP (Border Gateway Protocol) to exchange routes.

### 3. **Transit Gateway Route Tables**
   - You can create **multiple TGW route tables** for segmentation (e.g., for different teams or security domains).
   - **Associations:** Attachments associated with a route table use it for outbound traffic.
   - **Propagations:** Determine which routes are learned and inserted into a route table.

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture Example

```text
              +-----------------+
              | On-Prem Network |
              +--------+--------+
                       |
                  (VPN / DX)
                       |
              +--------v--------+
              |  Transit Gateway|
              +--------+--------+
                       |
   +---------+---------+---------+---------+
   |         |                   |         |
   v         v                   v         v
[VPC A]   [VPC B]             [VPC C]   [VPC D]
````

Each VPC and VPN is attached to the TGW. You can isolate or allow communication between attachments using route tables.

## üöÄ Use Cases

* Centralized VPC connectivity (hub-and-spoke)
* Hybrid cloud architecture (connect on-prem with AWS)
* Network segmentation (prod, dev, staging)
* Multi-Region VPC peering (using TGW peering)
* Simplified route management compared to VPC peering

## ‚öôÔ∏è Setup Guide (Simplified)

1. **Create a Transit Gateway**

   ```bash
   aws ec2 create-transit-gateway --description "My TGW" --options AmazonSideAsn=64512
   ```

2. **Attach a VPC to TGW**

   ```bash
   aws ec2 create-transit-gateway-vpc-attachment \
       --transit-gateway-id tgw-xxxxxxxx \
       --vpc-id vpc-xxxxxxxx \
       --subnet-ids subnet-xxxxxxx subnet-yyyyyyy
   ```

3. **Update VPC Route Tables**

   ```bash
   aws ec2 create-route \
       --route-table-id rtb-xxxxxxxx \
       --destination-cidr-block 10.0.0.0/16 \
       --transit-gateway-id tgw-xxxxxxxx
   ```

4. **Create and Associate TGW Route Table**

   ```bash
   aws ec2 create-transit-gateway-route-table --transit-gateway-id tgw-xxxxxxxx
   aws ec2 associate-transit-gateway-route-table \
       --transit-gateway-route-table-id tgw-rtb-xxxxxxxx \
       --transit-gateway-attachment-id tgw-attach-yyyyyyyy
   ```

5. **Enable Propagation**

   ```bash
   aws ec2 enable-transit-gateway-route-table-propagation \
       --transit-gateway-route-table-id tgw-rtb-xxxxxxxx \
       --transit-gateway-attachment-id tgw-attach-yyyyyyyy
   ```

## üõ°Ô∏è Best Practices

* Use **multiple route tables** to segment traffic.
* Use **tags** for organizing TGW resources.
* Monitor with **Amazon CloudWatch**.
* Plan CIDR blocks to avoid overlaps.
* Use **Resource Access Manager (RAM)** to share TGW across accounts.
